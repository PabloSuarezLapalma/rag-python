The creation of a general affiliation system has the fundamental purpose of strengthening the academic and professional training of students, graduates and teachers through performance in professorships, extension and research projects; in the first case, from this Faculty, and, in the second, from the University itself and other Houses of Higher Studies. In this way, the figure of the seconded member makes it possible to clearly contribute to the expansion, consolidation and structural optimization of the teaching staff and, consequently, to a better and superior development of the Teaching, Research and Extension functions of the Faculty of Science and Technology. Likewise, it contributes significantly to the training of human resources by the Faculty itself in two senses: the activity of the applicant involves a double process of teaching and learning that is simultaneous and complementary to each other: on the one hand, the applicant has the possibility of providing series of specific knowledge specific to their scientific and, where appropriate, professional training, and on the other hand, they contribute through a new type of learning to the improvement of their own scientific, academic and even professional training; At the same time, it allows you to acquire or add experience in teaching, extension or research activities in a certain area. Thus, the objectives established for those assigned are partially common to those established for teachers and for students of the various careers that are developed within the scope of the Faculty of Science and Technology.
